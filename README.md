# Todo_App_Go

Full stack CRUD application using Go and React

## Backend API architecture

- Using Golang to create REST API's `GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, OPTION`
- Routing through Gin-Gonic framework because of its lightweight and faster performance 
- MongoDB 
- Creating various middleware function which performs the CRUD operations in mongoDB. 
- A custom middleware to handle preflight `CORS` checks on the server side.

## Front end 

A simple React application which consumes the REST API's to create, update and delete tasks. Using the semantic UI to create styled components.
